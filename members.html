            <h5>The Creator Of This Wonderful Design</h5>

            <p>Destiny doesn&#8217;t start with a step, design, or dream, and it doesn&#8217;t end with achievement, wins, or respect. It&#8217;s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to produce successful result, or it&#8217;s the plan that GOD has put in place for you.</p>

            <p>In Mudasiru&#8217;s session I will explore how I Lived My life in FUTA, the things it taught me either in a hard way or in an easy way. The things i don&#8217;t, understand why it happend, and that is where Destiny comes in. Once you&#8217;ve gotten to a tough situation just know that all will alright.</p>
