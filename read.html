          <h2>A Quick Story</h2>
          <h5>A Very Bad Day For Me</h5>
        
          <p>The first day i resumed to FUTA for my p-degree program, when i got to the lodge it was locked and my room-mate wasn't in, i had to go the school to get the key to the room from him.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile i came with my foodstuffs,gas,chicken and oil, so particularly there was a bag containing the gas,chicken and the oil together,so i left them outside the lodge.</p>
          <p>So i went to the school and i got the key from sodeeq, so on getting back to the lodge that bag was gone, My chicken  &#128544; was gone i was very annoyed that day </p>
          <p>Till now Sodeeq and I, stll talks about it not in a regretful way but as part of our experience.</p>
          
          <h4>Another Bad Day</h4>

          <p>It was in 300lv first semester when my result came out, There was a particular course(CHE301) that i did. I did the exam to my satisfaction,to the extent that i was playing during the exam.</p>
          <p>And when the result came out it was very very bad &#128542;.</p>
          <p>When i got to the lodge that day i met Tunji And Lekan at home, then i them about the result and i was like my life has finished a whole "4 unit course" and i got an "F"</p>
          <p>Those two idiot were laughing &#128514; at me. Anyway when my Roommate came back i told him, &#128514; and i don't know what happened or what he said i knew that a load was lifted from my Heart</p>
         
          <h4>A Good Day</h4>
          <h6>It Was The Day We All Went To A Birthday Party</h6>

          <P>So on that day we attended brother George birthday, so when we got there we drank boom juice and pomo meat before bro george opened the drinks for us to drink.</P>
          <P>At that time sodeeq wasn't with us. I called him that he should be coming, when he got there bro G has already been showing signs of tipiness &#128514;</P>
          <p>On that day Lekan didn't drink much and he was still telling Georgizoo to keep on drinking, when george was drunk that was when the fun began &#128514; he started dancing and kept hit things which was funny at the beginning</p>
          <P>Then it got worse, he started cursing for lekan who that time was already outside&#128514; and kept hitting his chest.</P>
